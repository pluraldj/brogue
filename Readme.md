# Brogue

Brogue is a Roguelike game for Mac OS X, Windows and Linux by Brian Walker.

## How to Play

You are the **@** symbol. Move around the dungeon with the vi-keys (**hjklyubn**) or keypad keys. The arrow keys will also work, but they do not allow diagonal movement.

Other commands are as listed in the help screen, which you can access by typing a question mark. I strongly encourage at least a cursory inspection of this list of commands, as many are non-standard in the roguelike genre, and the player may not otherwise realize that some commands even exist (such as the command to list '**D**'iscovered items or automatically e'**X**'plore the dungeon).

Your goal is to travel to the 26th subterranean floor of the dungeon, retrieve the Amulet of Yendor and return with it to the surface. For the truly skillful who desire further challenge, depths below 26 contain three lumenstones each â€“ items which confer no benefit except an increased score upon victory.

Games can be '**S**'uspended and '**O**'pened at a later time. Recordings of games can be saved when the game ends, and later '**V**'iewed.
